`canvas_fish` is inspired by the work of [Cartagen](http://cartagen.org) and [Eric Fischer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/). The goal is to create a fast json endpoint for simple 2d mapping in html5 canvas elements, minimal enough to enable scrolling and zooming without pre-rendering images. Most of the work will be on the data and javascript sides but I want to test the feasibility of a constrained C implementation of some of the basics. So far it is pretty encouraging, see for example [this screenshot of 80,000+](http://www.flickr.com/photos/79112603@N00/5911967242/) polygons that rendered in 5 or so seconds (most anything on the web would have to be simplified, but still). For now there is an implementation of the base OGC types, and a fastcgi endpoint that delivers geometries in pre-scaled pixel values.

Dependencies for now: MySQL with development headers (Postgres forthcoming), [fastcgi](http://www.fastcgi.com/) c libraries, and something like `Nginx` and `spawn-fcgi`. Run `start_fish.sh` to build and check comments if you have trouble. Load sample sql dump and edit the first few lines of `canvas_fish.c` correspondingly.
